# Schematic and Layout Design of 1-bit Full Adder.
<br>
<h2>I. Introduction:</h2>
Full Adder is the adder that adds three inputs and produces two outputs. The first two inputs are A and B and the third input is an input carry as C. The output carry is designated as C0 and the normal output is designated as S which is SUM. The C0 is also known as the majority 1â€™s detector, whose output goes high when more than one input is high. A full adder logic is designed in such a manner that can take eight inputs together to create a byte-wide adder and cascade the carry bit from one adder to another. we use a full adder because when a carry-in bit is available, another 1-bit adder must be used since a 1-bit half-adder does not take a carry-in bit. A 1-bit full adder adds three operands and generates 2-bit results.

<h1>II. Advantages of Full Adder in Digital Logic:</h1>
<br>
1.Flexibility: A full snake can add three information bits, making it more flexible than a half viper. It can likewise be utilized to add multi-bit numbers by binding different full adders together.
<br>
2.Carry Info: The full viper has a convey input, which permits it to perform expansion of multi-bit numbers and to chain different adders together.
<br>
3.Speed: The full snake works at an extremely fast, making it reasonable for use in rapid computerized circuits.

<br>
<h1>Application of Full Adder in Digital Logic:</h1>

<br>1.Arithmetic circuits: Full adders are utilized in math circuits to add twofold numbers. At the point when different full adders are associated in a chain, they can add multi-bit paired numbers.
<br>
2.Data handling: Full adders are utilized in information handling applications like advanced signal handling, information encryption, and mistake rectification.
<br>
3.Counters: Full adders are utilized in counters to addition or decrement the count by one.
<br>
4.Multiplexers and demultiplexers: Full adders are utilized in multiplexers and demultiplexers to choose and course information.
<br>
5.Memory tending to: Full adders are utilized in memory addressing circuits to produce the location of a particular memory area.
<br>
6.ALUs: Full adders are a fundamental part of Number juggling Rationale Units (ALUs) utilized in chip and computerized signal processors.
